# UTXO.25 "Reunioniverse"

Three years after the first act of UTXO.22, we revisit the roots and introduce the next act. The crypto community is constantly evolving, and so we must adapt to these changes. However, this does not mean that we reject basic ideas such as openness, transparency, and community involvement. In fact, we will aim to build on the UTXO.22 concept and create something even more aligned with its core principles.
