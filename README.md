# UTXO.25 "Reunioniverse"

> This event symbolically honors those who have left the crypto world due to greed and opportunism.

Three years after the first act of UTXO.22, we revisit the roots and introduce the next chapter. The crypto community is constantly evolving, and so we must adapt to these changes. However, this does not mean that we reject basic ideas such as openness, transparency, and community involvement. In fact we want to create something even more aligned with core principles.

## New concepts

### Bilingual conference

The concept of the UTXO conference was designed to first focus purely on the local audience, and in the following years shift to connecting this local community with the global community. And that is exactly our goal with UTXO.25. Our plan is that half of the lectures will now be in English, from world-class speakers. We will thus offer a completely unique opportunity to unite the entire community, across the entire spectrum of people, from absolute beginners to experts.

### Experiences hosting

Experiences will now be fully community-based, and everyone will be able to come up with their own experience within the conference. There will be no fee for non-commercial entities and the experience can be financially sponsored directly by the conference.

### Hackathon

The conference will now also include a hackathon, which will be focused on building local development projects.

### Co-working space

There will be a co-working space within the conference area where attendees will be able to work and network. Registration will be required for access to co-working.

### UTXO Guild

Organizers, volunteers and other people who contribute to the organization will be associated in the Guild, and will be entitled to a percentage reward after the conference, according to their contribution. This is our effort to make the conference sustainable in the long term.

The inspiration for the UTXO Guild is the [Protocol Guild](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/).

### #BringYourFriend campaign

The conference should also be available to absolute newcomers to cryptocurrencies. We will include beginner topics in the program, where there will be a special program section just for them. In addition, each newcomer receives a special printed beginner's guide as well as other perks.

Anyone who brings a crypto-newbie to UTXO.25 will receive special privileges and benefits. The more newcomers you bring in, the better!
