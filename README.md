# UTXO.25 "Reunioniverse"

> This event symbolically honors those who have left the crypto world due to greed and opportunism.

Three years after the first act of UTXO.22, we revisit the roots and introduce the next chapter. The crypto community is constantly evolving, and so we must adapt to these changes. However, this does not mean that we reject basic ideas such as openness, transparency, and community involvement. In fact we want to create something even more aligned with core principles.

## New concepts

### Bilingual conference

The concept of the UTXO conference was designed to first focus purely on the local audience, and in the following years shift to connecting this local community with the global community. And that is exactly our goal with UTXO.25. Our plan is that half of the lectures will now be in English, from world-class speakers. We will thus offer a completely unique opportunity to unite the entire community, across the entire spectrum of people, from absolute beginners to experts.

### Experiences hosting

Experiences will now be fully community-based, and everyone will be able to come up with their own experience within the conference. There will be no fee for non-commercial entities and the experience can be financially sponsored directly by the conference.

### Hackathon

The conference will now also include a hackathon, which will be focused on building local development projects.
